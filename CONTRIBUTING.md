# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

To allow us to offer dual-licensing (AGPL for the community, commercial licenses for enterprises), we require all contributors to accept one of the following before we can accept pull requests:

- Sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) (recommended), or
- Accept the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) by adding a "Signed-off-by" line to your commits.

How to sign the CLA
1. Open an issue requesting CLA signing (or follow the form we provide).
2. We will send back a CLA link or instructions.

How to use DCO
- Add `Signed-off-by: Your Name <email@example.com>` to your commit message (see `git commit -s`).

Other rules
- Put license headers in new source files referencing AGPLv3.
- Run tests and linters before opening a PR.
- Describe your change in the PR and link relevant issues.

If you have questions about licensing or corporate use, contact: licensing@levantar.ai
