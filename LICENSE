GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright (C) 2026 Levantar AI (Company number 16584071)

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU AGPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
if it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1)
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that
there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties
are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License,
and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a
list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in
the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A "Major
Component", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel,
display server, or window system) of the specific operating system
(including the corresponding libraries), or a compiler used to produce
the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work)
run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities. However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
equivalently obtain from outside the source distribution, such as
standard libraries or macros.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control; they may not copy or distribute the works or make them
available to others.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes
it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or any
similar law prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to prevent circumvention of
technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

  a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
  it, and giving a relevant date.

  b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
  released under this License and any conditions added under section
  7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
  "keep intact all notices".

  c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License
  to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License does
  not permit licensing the work in any other way, but it does not
  invalidate such additional permissions as may be provided
  separately. For example, a company might distribute a program in
  object code form under its own proprietary license, provided that
  the corresponding source code is also distributed under this License.

  d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
  Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
  interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
  work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:

  a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
  Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
  used for software interchange.

  b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
  (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
  written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
  long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product,
  to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of
  the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that
  is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
  used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
  reasonable cost of physically performing this distribution service,
  or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server
  at no charge.

  c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
  written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative
  is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
  received the object code with such an offer, in accord with
  subsection b.

  d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
  place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
  Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
  further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
  Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
  copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
  may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
  that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
  clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
  Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
  Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
  available for as long as necessary to satisfy these requirements.

  e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
  you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
  Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
  charge under subsection d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

The requirement to provide Corresponding Source does not include the
work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally
available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those
activities but which are not part of the work. If the work is an
aggregate, the Corresponding Source for the entire aggregate is not
required.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may add
additional permissions to a covered work only for yourself, always
provided that you comply with this License in all other respects.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from this
  License; or

  b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
  author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
  Notices displayed by works containing it; or

  c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
  requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
  reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

  d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
  authors, or recommending particular user interfaces, showing that
  such things are not required by this License.

Other than as expressly stated above, you may not impose any further
restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under
this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,
or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License,
with the exception of charging a reasonable fee for physical
conveying of source material.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
automatically as a result of court order, or (b) upon express
reinstatement by the copyright holder.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received such notice, and you cure the violation within 30 days of
receiving the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not restored,
that will not prevent you from receiving new licenses for the same
material from the copyright holders.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation rights, such as
reflexive rights of others to run the Program, are not limited by
whether you accept this License. However, nothing else grants you
permission to propagate or modify the Program or its derivative works
except as expressly provided under this License. These actions infringe
copyright if you do not accept this License.

Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate
your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or that organization
with the assets of another. If propagation of a covered work results
from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives
a copy of the covered work also receives whatever licenses to the
covered work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give
under the previous paragraph.

You may not convey a covered work with a license that contradicts
this License.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(or to enforce a patent only in specified circumstances), and a
"patent license" includes licenses to the extent of any patent
claims granted by a contributor.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to
copy, free of charge and under this License, through a publicly
available network server or other readily accessible means, then you
must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or
(2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license
for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with
the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to
downstream recipients. "Knowingly relying" means you have actual
knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered
work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a
country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, under circumstances not described in the previous paragraph, you
convey a covered work, and you grant a patent license to some of the
parties receiving the covered work, then the patent license you
grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work
and includes the right to sublicense. A patent license is "discriminatory"
if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the
exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of
the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may
not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a
third party that is in the business of distributing software, under
which you make payment to the third party based on your conveying of
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
recipients of the work from you, a discriminatory patent license
(or other discriminatory patent covenant) to the work, unless you
entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that
require you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to
whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of section 13 of the GNU Affero General
Public License, and the requirements of section 13 of the GNU General
Public License, when applicable, will apply to the combination as
appropriate.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified
version or of any later version that has been published (not as a
draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version
ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of civil liability in connection with the Program,
unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the
Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
use the "copyright" word ("Copyright" or (C)) with the year of first
publication and the name of the copyright holder. Also add an
appropriate notice saying that the program is licensed under this
License and any conditions added under section 7. You should also give
the URL of the GNU website where this License is available, and a
general disclaimer of warranty. The recommended form of notice is:

  Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

  This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
  it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
  published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
  License, or (at your option) any later version.
